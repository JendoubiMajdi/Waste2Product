## Passion template migration notes

This repository was created as a fresh Laravel application to host the Passion template you provided in the parent workspace. The following actions were taken:

- Copied the original `assets/` folder into `public/assets` so static files are served by Laravel.
- Converted several existing views into Blade templates and placed them into `resources/views` (including `auth` views and `layouts/app.blade.php`).
- Added simple routes for `/`, `/login`, `/register`, and `/forgot-password` in `routes/web.php`.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd laravel-app
composer install
copy .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

Notes:
- Authentication logic is not implemented (you previously asked not to install Breeze). The auth routes currently return the static views and POST handlers are placeholders in `routes/web.php`.
- If you'd like real Laravel authentication (controllers, database-backed users and password reset emails), I can install Laravel Breeze and wire it up.
